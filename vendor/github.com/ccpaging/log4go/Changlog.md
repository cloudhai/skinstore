* Migrate log variables (rec, closeq, closing, etc.) into Filters

* Add new method for Filter include NewFilter(), Close(), run(), WriteToChan()

* When closing, Filter:
  
  + Drain all left log records
  
  + Write them by LogWriter interface
  
  + Then close interface
  
* Every Filter run a routine to recv rec and call LogWriter to write

* LogWrite can be call directly, see log4go_test.go

* Add new method to Logger include skip(), dispatch()
